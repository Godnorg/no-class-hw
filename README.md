This is a recipe box application where you can type in your recipes and submit it. There are initial recipes given, but you can give yours. There is a delete button for recipes you want to delete and when you're ready to add your recipe, you can just press the add button to add it to the list of recipes given.

I faced the challenge of doing the background color but I realized I had to expand the max-width and max-height and then set the width and height to those measurements so it would fit the page. Then I could do the background color in #root. I had trouble adjusting some of the buttons as well but I just did margin and tiny measurements of px.
